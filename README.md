The development process for both the site and the theme is streamlined using npm. Follow these instructions to start working on them:

1. Install dependencies 
```sh
npm install
```

2. Activate development mode
```sh
npm run dev
```

After activating the development mode, the site will be on watch mode, and any changes detected will trigger a rebuild of Tailwind and Hugo.
